Columns are SNP, the effect allele, the other allele, frequency of the effect allele, effect size, standard error, p-value and sample size. The headers are not keywords and will be omitted by the program. Important: "A1" needs to be the effect allele with "A2" being the other allele and "freq" should be the frequency of "A1".

--p-value 0.4

This option will remove SNPs with GWAS P value greater than the specified value, e.g. 0.4, from the analysis.

--ldm test.ldm.sparse

Input the LD matrix generated by --make-sparse-ldm option. This option tells GCTB to read two files: a text file that contains SNP information (test.ldm.sparse.info) and a binary file that contains the sparse LD matrix data (test.ldm.sparse.bin). The suffix ".sparse" tells GCTB the format of the LD matrix. The valid suffixes include ".full", ".band", ".shrunk" and ".sparse", which are generated from the corresponding options that make the LD matrix in sush a format, e.g. --make-full-ldm for ".full" files.

--exclude-mhc

--maf 0.01
--overlap
This option tells GCTB that the LD reference sample is in complete overlap with the GWAS sample. That is, the LD matrix is computed from the GWAS sample itself. This will suppress the modeling of sampling variance of LD correlations in the Sbayes analysis.

#are allele dosages normalised in GWAS
#--unscale-genotype

--num-chains 4
This option invokes a multi-chain MCMC process, e.g. 4 chains. GCTB will run multiple chains in sequence each with the starting values of the model parameters randomly sampled from their prior distributions. When the MCMC chains are completed, it will calculate the Gelman-Rubin convergence diagnostic (also known as potential scale reduction factor) for each of the model parameters and report them in the .parRes file. For example,
